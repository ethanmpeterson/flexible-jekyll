# Introduction
- Is a capstone project serving as a culmination of four years in Computer Engineering
- Goals:
  - Try to showcase the "full stack" of skills that a Computer Engineer might have
  - Electrical and PCB design.
  - Digital Design in the form of the FPGA.
  - Knowledge of signals and systems and DSP.
  - Networking and communications protocols
  - Systems level programming (the main oscilloscope applications)
  - Ensure each member of the group had something to learn.

# Hardware Design
- Focus on test points and debuggability in board size and layout.
- Board architecture diagram
- Altium embed

- 40MSPS ADC de-risking with stuff options to bypass front-end amplifiers and voltage clamps.
- Choice to use dedicated FPGA DIP module in lieu of chip shortage
- Main issue was incorrectly routed clock pin.

- Reference section in report PDF for full HW deep dive

# FPGA Firmware Design
- FTDI driver
- Use of AXI streams
- Refer to overall capstone report
- Add figure of the FPGA block diagram

# Software Design
- Credit Eric Yang here.
- Refer to the report. Provide the top level flow diagram as a figure

# Gallery and Awards
- Group photo with the project
- Winning both IEEE and the ECE competition.

# Conclusion
- Great way to end time in Computer Engineering and get exposure to FPGAs which I had not experience outside of basic coursework
