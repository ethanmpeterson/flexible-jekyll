# Introduction
TeachEE (Teach Electrical Engineering) is a USB oscilloscope implemented with an
FPGA, custom PCB, and accompanying desktop application. TeachEE was my capstone
project and served as the culmination of my four years in Computer Engineering
at Queen's. Despite the branding, there was no commercial intention behind TeachEE
as similar cheap USB-based instruments already exist for students. Instead, the
purpose of the project was to showcase the "full stack" of skills learned in
Computer Engineering.

The project gave me the opportunity the build a complete product from the
hardware to the software. TeachEE allowed me to make use of the
skills I had learned in my degree and internships:
- Electrical and PCB Design
- Digital Design and Hardware Description Languages (HDLs)
- Knowledge of Signals and Systems, and Digital Signal Processing (DSP)
- Networking and basic communication protocols
- Systems Level Programming

The broad scope of the project required expertise in multiple disciplines within
Electrical and Computer Engineering. The benefit of the large scope was that
each group member (Eric Yang, Ethan Peterson, Timothy Morland, John Giorshev)
could find an area of the project with technical work that interested them.

I took on the hardware design and FPGA firmware as this best aligned with my
career background and interests. Eric developed the desktop application for
TeachEE, which would display the waveforms sampled by the hardware. The desktop
program also allowed for triggering functionality, Fast Fourier Transforms
(FFTs), and other basic functions expected of an oscilloscope.

Tim and John took ownership of the signal generator used for TeachEE demos in
presentations and competitions. The signal generator utilized the Digital to
Analog Converter (DAC) of an Arduino Due to generate arbitrary waveforms to
showcase the features of TeachEE. The signal generator used a joystick input to
modulate frequency, amplitude, and phase of a signal.

## System Design and Block Diagram

Given below is a system block diagram for the TeachEE PCB.

![hw-block-diagram](../assets/img/teachee/hw-block-diagram.png)

At a high level, the FPGA is responsible for consuming voltage and current
samples from three voltage channels and one current monitoring channel.
Specifications for each channel are listed below.
- 2x 40 MSPS 8-bit ADC voltage channels
- 1 MSPS 16-bit ADC low-speed voltage channel
- 1 MSPS 16-bit ADC current monitoring channel

### Voltage and Current Channels
The FPGA's internal ADC is used for one of the voltage channels and the current
monitoring channel. These channels are limited to 1 MSPS while the external ADC
can produce up to 40 MSPS. The slower 1MSPS channels were not initially planned
but are "free" to add since the FPGA had a built-in ADC of its own.

Each voltage channel has a Low Pass Filter (LPF) on its input to clamp signals
to an acceptable frequency based on the [Nyquist
Theorem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nyquist%E2%80%93Shannon_sampling_theorem).
Additionally, the two high-speed voltage channels connected to the AD9288 40
MSPS ADC have a differential amplifier on the input, which is used to convert
the single-ended signal to a differential signal that the ADC can sample. The
FPGA is responsible for generating the sampling clock to the high-speed ADC. 40
MSPS is the maximum rate, but any speed can be chosen.

### Power Distribution
The board is fully powered by USB which imposes a 5Vx1A (5W) power limit on the
PCB. In practice, the PCBA rarely draws current in excess of 100mA. An LDO is
used to produce a 3.3V internal power domain.

### USB Communication
In order to leverage maximum USB transfer speeds, the full parallel interface of
the FT232H USB FIFO is wired to the FPGA. In this configuration, the FT232H
generates a 60 MHz clock used to align the 8-bit parallel bus. The FPGA's
internal state machine aligns to this clock and allows the system to transfer a
byte of data in each 60 MHz clock cycle. This is known as the "Synchronous Mode"
for FT232H. The Synchronous mode allows the FT232H to utilize the full bandwidth
available on a USB2.0 interface. For the purposes of TeachEE, the 480 Mbps
bandwidth of USB2.0 was sufficient for transferring samples at the desired
speeds.

## Schematic Design
The TeachEE hardware had to be designed and fabricated within the span of a
single semester to allow time for software and FPGA firmware development. As a
result, there was only time for a single manufacturing run of the PCB.

Under these constraints, it was critical that the PCB be easy to debug in the
case of hardware issues. To accommodate this, I did the following:
- Test points on all digital signals connected to the FPGA.
- BOM stuff options to bypass the LPFs on all voltage channels.
- BOM stuff options to bypass the differential amplifiers on the high speed ADC circuit.
- Empty pads to allow the high speed ADC to accept a single-ended input.
- Use of an external FPGA module connected through a pin header. The decoupling
  of the FPGA ensured it could be manually wired if there was a mistake in the
  PCB pinout.

## Layout Design
TeachEE is a four layer PCB. The two external layers are used for signals and
power, while the internal layers are ground planes. This stackup was used to
achieve optimal signal integrity with high speed signals coming from the ADC and
USB FIFO.

The TeachEE is larger than necessary to make space for the debugging features
listed in the schematic section. All test points and BOM stuff options are
spaced out from one another making them easily accessible by oscilloscope
probes. Additionally, the board has several dedicated ground tabs that can be
used to minimize ground loop size when debugging higher speed signals on the
board.

Luckily, these debugging features were not needed as board bring-up went
smoothly. The only error in the hardware was wiring the FT232H output clock to a
non-clock-capable pin on the FPGA. This issue was mitigated in firmware by
minimizing the size of the 60 MHz FT232H clock domain as much as possible in the
FPGA logic fabric. Eventually, the logic was optimized to a point where the
synthesized design could still meet timing constraints.

# FPGA Firmware Design
The FPGA on TeachEE is responsible for taking samples from the voltage and
current channels across multiple clock domains and queuing them for transfer to
the desktop application over USB. The FPGA also has to frame the samples into
USB packets that can be easily and quickly decoded by the desktop application in
order to support the high 40 MSPS sample rate.

Given below is the block diagram describing the FPGA datapath. A full
module-by-module breakdown is provided in section 3.2 of the report
embedded at the top of the post.

![fpga-block-diagram](../assets/img/teachee/fpga-block-diagram.png)

The FPGA has dedicated modules to collect samples from the low and high speed
ADCs respectively. Each module outputs the data on an AXI stream. AXI streams
are used as a standard interface between modules in the FPGA to make use of
various FIFO IPs for queuing samples. These asynchronous FIFOs are used to carry
samples across the various clock domains in the datapath until they can be
encoded and sent over USB. The FTDI module takes an AXI stream as input and
converts it to the parallel interface of the FT232H.

Samples are encoded using [Consistent Overhead Byte Stuffing
(COBS)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consistent_Overhead_Byte_Stuffing).
However, the FPGA takes an extra step to guarantee a fixed frame size so that
the desktop application can have a faster decoding algorithm.

# Software Design
[Eric Yang](https://www.linkedin.com/in/eric-yang-9bb055193/) in our capstone
group completed the desktop Rust application for TeachEE. This multi-threaded
application consumed the multi-channel sample stream from the TeachEE PCB and
implemented full oscilloscope functionality, including but not limited to:
- Multi-channel display
- Fast Fourier Transforms
- Triggers
- Time and amplitude scaling

Given below is a sequence diagram for the desktop application and a screenshot of the final UI.

# Conclusion
Overall, TeachEE is a culmination of all my favorite subjects in Electrical and
Computer Engineering. Moreover, it was a fantastic way to end my time at Queen's
Computer Engineering. I was thrilled that the project was well-received by the
department and that we were able to integrate both hardware and software into a
single capstone project.
